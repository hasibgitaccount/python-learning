Final Part: Procedural Python with ML Application

22. Project: Machine Learning Workflow Automation

A. Write a procedural Python script that loads a dataset (e.g., CSV or from an API), cleans it (handles missing values, normalization), splits it into training and testing sets, trains a simple machine learning model (like a linear regression), and evaluates the model’s performance (e.g., using MSE or accuracy).
B. Extend the above project to allow it to save the trained model and load it for future predictions.

Why These Exercises Matter for Your ML Journey:

=> Data Preprocessing: A major part of machine learning is preparing the data. Procedural Python will help you write custom data preprocessing functions, which is essential for cleaning and transforming data before feeding it into models.

=> Basic Algorithms & Search: Understanding basic search algorithms like binary and linear search helps when you're working with large datasets and need efficient ways to handle them.

=> Custom Metrics & Evaluation: You will need to create custom metrics (like MSE or accuracy) to evaluate models, especially when the predefined metrics in libraries are insufficient or you are developing your own algorithms.

=> Model Persistence: In ML, saving and loading models is crucial when deploying them in production. Learning how to implement this functionality ensures you can easily save trained models and reuse them.

=> Data Visualization: Data visualization is essential in machine learning for both exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model evaluation. You will need to visualize data distributions, relationships between features, and model performance metrics.

By completing these exercises, you will have a solid procedural Python foundation that will directly apply to machine learning tasks such as data processing, algorithm implementation, and model evaluation.
