Part 1: Strong Basics (Foundation)

1. Class Basics and Initialization:

A. Create a Person class with attributes like name, age, and gender. Include methods to check if the person is an adult.

2. Inheritance:

A. Create an Employee subclass with attributes for salary and a method to calculate yearly salary.
B. Create a Vehicle class and a Car subclass that adds attributes like num_doors.

3. Encapsulation:

A. Create a BankAccount class with private attributes for balance, and methods for deposit/withdrawal and checking balance.
B. Implement basic getter and setter methods for encapsulation.

4. Polymorphism:

A. Implement method overriding in a Shape class. Create subclasses like Circle, Square, and Triangle that calculate area differently.

5. Dunder Methods (Magic Methods):

A. Implement __repr__() and __eq__() methods for string representation and comparison between Person objects.

6. File Handling:

A. Write methods to save and load object data (like a BankAccount class) to/from a file.

7. Exception Handling:

A. Handle exceptions like insufficient balance when withdrawing from a BankAccount class.

Part 2: Strong Intermediate (Real-World OOP Practices)

1. Class Methods and Static Methods:

A. Implement a class method to create an Account in a banking system.
B. Use a static method to validate an account number format.

2. Abstract Classes and Interfaces:

A. Create an abstract class Shape with an abstract method draw() and implement this method in subclasses (Circle, Rectangle).

3. Method Overloading:

A. Implement method overloading in a class like Person where the greet() method can handle different parameters (like a greeting based on time of day).(skip for now).

4. Composition:

A. Create Library and Book classes where a Library has many Books and can check if a book is available for borrowing.

5. Multiple Inheritance:

A. Create a Person class and a Job class, then combine them into a Worker class that inherits from both.(skip for now).

6. Singleton Pattern (Relevance for ML):

A. Implement the Singleton pattern to ensure only one instance of a class like DatabaseConnection is created.

7. Strategy Pattern (ML Relevance):

A. Implement a PaymentStrategy interface with different payment methods (like credit card and PayPal). In ML, this can relate to various model selection strategies.

Part 3: Advanced (Advanced OOP for ML Projects)

1. Factory Pattern (ML Relevance):

A. Implement a ShapeFactory class that returns shapes (like Circle, Square, etc.) based on user input. This concept can be applied to dynamically select different ML models in your projects.

2. Observer Pattern (ML Relevance):

A. Implement a WeatherStation class (subject) with observers like MobileApp and TVStation. This pattern can be useful in real-time ML systems, such as model monitoring.(skip for now).

3. Unit Testing and Testing Libraries:

A. Learn unit testing for your classes (use unittest or pytest) and write tests for various OOP implementations like BankAccount or Person.

4. SOLID Principles (ML Relevance):

A. Apply SOLID principles to your codebase. For example, in a Model class for ML, ensure it follows the Single Responsibility Principle by keeping model training separate from evaluation.

5. Design Patterns in Machine Learning:

A. Learn how design patterns like Singleton, Factory, and Observer can be used for managing model training, evaluation, and deployment.
