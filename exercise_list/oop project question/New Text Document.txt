📚 Library Management System (OOP Project)

Why this project?
=> Covers Classes, Inheritance, Composition, File Handling, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Exception Handling—everything you’ve learned.
=> It’s real-world but simple enough to finish fast.
=> Sets you up for thinking in data structures, which helps in NumPy/Pandas later.

✅ Core Features You Must Build (No Extra Fluff):

1. Entities (Classes)

=> Book
=> Member
=> Library

2. Book Class

=> Attributes: title, author, isbn, available (True/False)

=> Methods:
	=> __str__() ➡ for printing info
	=> mark_as_borrowed()
	=> mark_as_returned()

3. Member Class

=> Attributes: member_id, name, borrowed_books (list)

=> Methods:
	=> borrow_book(book)
	=> return_book(book)
	=> __str__() ➡ for member info

4. Library Class

=> Attributes:
	=> books ➡ list of Book objects
	=> members ➡ list of Member objects

=> Methods:
	=> add_book(book)
	=> add_member(member)
	=> borrow_book(member_id, isbn)
	=> return_book(member_id, isbn)
	=> show_available_books()
	=> save_data() ➡ writes current books & members to file
	=> load_data() ➡ reads books & members from file

5. Extra (Optional but Recommended):

=> Exception Handling
	=> Raise error if someone tries to borrow an unavailable book
	=> Raise error if the member ID is invalid
=> File Handling
	=> Store book/member data in a .txt or .json file

🏁 Project Completion Goal

=> Finish in 3-5 days (max)
=> Clean code: follow Encapsulation & SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
=> No extra features until core is working!
