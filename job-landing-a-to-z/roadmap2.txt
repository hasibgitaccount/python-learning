I see what you're asking now! You want an ultimate roadmap that goes beyond coding and covers all the other important areas like networking, showcasing your skills, creating a personal brand, and gaining visibility in the machine learning field.

Here’s a roadmap to guide you through this process, focusing on what you need to do outside of coding to stand out and progress in your machine learning career:

1. Personal Branding & Online Presence
Step 1: LinkedIn Profile

=> Goal: Create a strong LinkedIn profile that highlights your skills, learning journey, and projects.
=> Actions:
	=> Write a clear, engaging headline (e.g., "Aspiring Machine Learning Engineer | Python | Data Science").
	=> Fill in your experience, even if it's personal projects or courses you’ve completed.
	=> Showcase your machine learning projects with detailed descriptions and links to GitHub.
	=> Regularly update your profile and share insights or learnings about ML and coding.
Step 2: Portfolio Website

=> Goal: Have a professional-looking website that serves as your online portfolio.
=> Actions:
	=> Host your website on WordPress (as you mentioned, it's your platform of choice).
	=> Include sections like about me, projects, contact, and skills.
	=> Link to your GitHub, LinkedIn, and any other platforms you use like kaggele, Medium / Hashnode / DEV.to (choose one for writing),
	✅ 1. GitHub (a must-have)
	=> Why? It shows your code quality, project structure, and commitment. Recruiters always check GitHub.
	=> Tip: Pin 5–6 of your best projects (clean, documented, and relevant to the job you're targeting).
	✅ 2. LinkedIn (also essential)
	=> Why? For networking, endorsements, and recruiters. Many recruiters find candidates directly on LinkedIn.
	=> Tip: Write clear headlines like "Aspiring Machine Learning Engineer | Python Developer" and post about your projects or things you’re learning.
	✅ 3. Kaggle
	=> Why? It’s the platform for data science and machine learning. Even having a few kernels (notebooks) with your ML work looks good.
	=> How to use it: Join competitions, create notebooks explaining your ML projects, or share exploratory data analysis (EDA).
	=> Bonus: Kaggle ranks and medals are eye-catching!
	✅ 4. Medium / Hashnode / DEV.to (choose one for writing)
	=> Why? Writing technical blogs shows you understand what you build and can explain complex stuff simply.
	=> What to write about?
	=> Tutorials (e.g., "Beginner's Guide to Pandas")
	=> Project walkthroughs (e.g., "How I Built a Movie Recommendation System")
	=> Learnings (e.g., "5 Things I Learned Doing My First Machine Learning Project")
	=> Tip: Medium has better reach; Hashnode or DEV.to are easier to start with and free
	✅ 5. LeetCode / HackerRank / Codewars (optional, but helps)
	=> Why? If you’re targeting roles that need coding interviews, having a profile with good rankings or badges helps.
	=> Link if: You’ve solved 100+ problems or earned some ranks/badges.
	✅ 6. Personal Projects / App Demos
	=> How? Host your projects:
	=> On Streamlit Cloud or Hugging Face Spaces (for ML web apps)
	=> On Netlify or Vercel (if you build full websites or dashboards)
	=> Why? Showing live demos alongside GitHub code makes a strong impression.
	✅ 7. Google Scholar / ResearchGate (if you have papers)
	=> Only if you’re into academic ML or published research. Otherwise, skip!.
	=> Showcase your best machine learning projects with clear descriptions and code walkthroughs.
	=> Include your CV or a downloadable version on your site.
2. Networking & Community Engagement
Step 3: LinkedIn Networking

=> Goal: Build meaningful connections in the machine learning community.
=> Actions:
	=> Connect with professionals in the ML field (people from companies you admire, professors, etc.).
	=> Engage with content by liking, commenting, and sharing posts related to ML.
	=> Attend virtual meetups, webinars, and conferences (many are free and valuable for networking).
	=> Join ML and data science groups and contribute to discussions.
Step 4: GitHub Contributions

=> Goal: Show your work and contribute to open-source projects.
=> Actions:
	=> Regularly update your GitHub with personal projects and challenges you solve.
	=> Contribute to open-source ML projects, even if it’s just small improvements or bug fixes.
	=> Follow other ML developers on GitHub and learn from their code.
3. Content Creation & Showcasing Knowledge
Step 5: Blogging

=> Goal: Share your knowledge and experiences with the ML community.
=> Actions:
	=> Start a blog on platforms like Medium or Dev.to. You can also integrate it into your website.
	=> Write about the concepts you're learning (ML algorithms, coding tips, project walkthroughs).
	=> Share tutorials, research findings, and challenges you've faced.
	=> Posting consistently will improve your visibility and establish you as someone who shares valuable insights.
Step 6: Research Papers or Projects

=> Goal: Gain credibility by diving into ML research.
=> Actions:
	=> If possible, work on research papers or case studies and try to publish them on platforms like arXiv.
	=> Focus on explaining a problem, your methodology, and results in a clear and concise way.
	=> Alternatively, work on an in-depth project (e.g., predicting something real-world with ML) and document it extensively.
	=> Share your findings through blog posts, on GitHub, and LinkedIn.
4. Learning & Upgrading Skills
Step 7: Continuous Learning

=> Goal: Keep upgrading your skills in ML and related fields.
=> Actions:
	=> Enroll in online courses on Coursera, edX, or Udacity to deepen your knowledge in specific areas like deep learning, NLP, or reinforcement 	learning.
	=> Attend MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) to expand your understanding.
	=> Keep reading research papers to stay updated on the latest trends and techniques in ML.
5. Competitions & Real-World Practice
Step 8: Participate in Competitions

=> Goal: Improve your skills and gain recognition.
=> Actions:
	=> Join platforms like Kaggle and start participating in competitions. This will give you real-world data science problems to solve and help you 	improve your skills.
	=> Share your solutions and approaches on your blog or GitHub, showing potential employers your problem-solving abilities.
Step 9: Freelance or Collaborate on Projects

=> Goal: Gain hands-on experience and real-world projects.
=> Actions:
	=> Take on small freelance projects or internships related to ML to gain practical experience (you can find these on platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, 	or Toptal).
	=> If possible, collaborate on ML projects with peers or in open-source communities to enhance your learning and network.
6. Getting Your First Job/Internship
Step 10: Apply for Internships/Junior Roles

=> Goal: Start your professional career in ML.
=> Actions:
	=> Once you feel ready, start applying for internships or junior ML roles.
	=> Use your portfolio, GitHub, and LinkedIn profile to showcase your skills and past projects.
	=> Don’t hesitate to reach out to recruiters or people working in the field for advice or job opportunities.
Step 11: Prepare for Interviews

=> Goal: Be prepared to land that ML job.
=> Actions:
	=> Practice common ML interview questions and coding problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and InterviewBit.
	=> Prepare to explain your projects and showcase your problem-solving approach during interviews.
	=> Brush up on data structures, algorithms, and mathematics (since these are often tested in interviews for ML roles).
To Sum It Up:
=> Create an awesome LinkedIn profile to connect with professionals and stay active on there.
=> Build a portfolio website to showcase your skills and projects.
=> Share your knowledge through blogs, contribute to open-source, and start publishing research or case studies.
=> Network with ML professionals and join communities to stay updated and get opportunities.
=> Participate in Kaggle challenges and freelance to get real-world experience.
=> Start applying for jobs when you feel ready and practice for interviews.

This roadmap should help you build a strong online presence, network effectively, and gain practical experience while continuing your learning journey in machine learning.
